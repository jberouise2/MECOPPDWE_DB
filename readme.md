Hello, Iâ€™m Engr. Jabe, a licensed Registered Electrical Engineer.

I am also an aspiring Data Engineer, having actively upskilled since November 2023.
While my current employer does not yet require a dedicated Data Engineer, I have proactively applied my new skills by implementing a data pipeline in my work.
This allows me to reinforce my learning, streamline processes, and improve efficiency in my daily tasks.
